## 🏃‍ Usage

### 📦 Installation

The code was developed using node **v8.1.2** and it is recommend to stick around this version.

```sh
# install this project
npm install
# in addition you need the syft python library installed
pip install git+https://github.com/OpenMined/Syft.git
```

### 🏁 Start

You need to start the following things before you can use your mine:
* blockchain (testrpc for now)
* ipfs daemon

_Note: This seems to cause connection issues, as an alternative run the `start_env.sh` script if you have testrpc and ipfs installed locally_

This repository comes with a [docker-compose file](setup/docker-compose.yml) that allows you to bootstrap _ethereum_, _ipfs_ and any other services via one command.

```sh
# to start the development environment
npm run env-start

# or to stop
npm run env-stop
```

After you have the surrounding services mocked you can star the `Mine` using `npm start` which will put the application into a developer mode with [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) acting as as serversided live-reload.

You might want to head over to [pySonar](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySonar/blob/master/notebooks/Sonar%20-%20Decentralized%20Model%20Training%20Simulation%20(local%20blockchain).ipynb) and execute the notebook until **Step 1** to bootstrap your blockchain with some models. Feel free to execute additional steps to mock partially trained models.

```sh
npm start
```

You should see the following output:

## ⚙️ (Missing) Features

Currently the `Mine` polls a fixed `contractAddress` for available models and lists statistics.
Features that should follow:

* [x] Poll `Sonar` for available models
* [x] Download the model/weights via `IPFS`
* [x] Train the model using `syft`
* [ ] Get `contractAddress`/`mineAddress` via arguments/env variables
* [ ] Filter models for those matching available training data (requires feature change on Sonar contract)
* [ ] Proper docker setup to allow multiple mines

## 🐞 Known Issues

* the `npm install` requires a python executable `>= v2.5.0 & < 3.0.0` (child-dep of web3)
* with dockerized IPFS/testrpc there are a lot of connection issues
    * first run on a new docker env is working ~90%
